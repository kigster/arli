## Overview

This Arduino project uses CMake build system, and the Arduino-CMake project. It also uses `arli` CLI tool to manage it's library dependencies.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

 * On a Mac, you always need to run `xcode-select --install` before you can do any development. You must have `git` installed;

 * Requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
 * Requires [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or an SDK, either for [Mac](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.5-macosx.zip) or [Linux](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.5-linux.zip) installed;
 * Requires ruby, 2.3 or 2.4+ installed. On a Mac's Terminal, run `ruby --version`. If for some reason you don't have it installed, the `bin/setup` script will prompt you to install it.

### Building

You can build the project using provided BASH helpers:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/<%= project_name %>
$ bin/setup
$ bin/build
```

Or you can build manually using cmake/make:

```bash
$ cd ~/workspace/<%= project_name %>
$ rm -rf build && mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make                          # this builds the image
$ make upload                   # this uploads it to the device
$ # this next command opens a serial port monitor inside a screen session
$ make <%= project_name %>-serial
```

### Customizing the Build

You can use environment variables to set the board, CPU and the port. Simply prefix the following variables before you run `cmake ..`

```bash
$ rm -rf build && mkdir -p build && cd build
$ BOARD_NAME=nano \
  BOARD_CPU=atmega328p \
  BOARD_DEVICE=/dev/tty.usbserial-DA00WXFY \
  cmake ..
```

### Adding External Libraries

Your repo contains `Arlifile` (which is a YAML file) inside the `src` folder. Please [read the documentation](https://github.com/kigster/arli#arlifile-specification) about the format of `Arlifile`.

Go ahead and edit that file, and under `dependencies:` you want to list all of your libraries by their exact name, and an optional version.

The best way to do that is to **first search for the library** using the `arli search terms` command. Once you find the library you want, just copy it's name as is into `Arlifile`. If it contains spaces, put quotes around it.

For example:

```bash
$ arli search /adafruit.*bmp085/i

Arli (1.0.2), Command: search
Library Path: ~/Documents/Arduino/Libraries

Adafruit BMP085 Library                         (1.0.0)    ( 1 total versions )
Adafruit BMP085 Unified                         (1.0.0)    ( 1 total versions )
———————————————————————
  Total Versions : 2
Unique Libraries : 2
———————————————————————
```

If the library is not in the official database, just add it with a name and a url, and an optional sub-folder. Arli will use the url field to fetch it.

To verify that your Arlifile can resolve all libraries, please run `arli bundle` inside the `src` folder. If Arli succeeds, you've got it right, and the `libraries` folder inside `src` should contain all referenced libraries.

### Adding Source Files

You will notice that inside `src/CMakeLists.txt` file, there is a line:

```cmake
set(PROJECT_SOURCES <%= project_name %>.cpp)
```

If you add any additional source files or headers, just add their names right after, separated by spaces or newlines. For example:

```cmake
set(PROJECT_SOURCES
  <%= project_name %>.cpp
  <%= project_name %>.h
  helpers/Loader.cpp
  helpers/Loader.h
  config/Configuration.h
)
```

The should be all you need to do add custom logic and to rebuild and upload the project.
