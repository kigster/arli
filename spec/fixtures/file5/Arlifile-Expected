# NOTE: This file has been auto-generated by the Arli library manager
# which integrates with another project `arduino-cmake`. If you are
# curious as to how you can build complex Arduino Projects using Arli,
# we suggest that you run the following commands to explore Arli:
# 
#      arli generate MyTestProject --workspace ~/workspace
#      cd ~/workspace/MyTestProject
#      bin/setup
#      bin/build src
#
# And you should see a binary image built for the default board, or the 
# board you specified in the Arlifile.
